# Laser Tripwire System

## Overview
The Laser Tripwire System is an IoT project designed to create a security perimeter using a laser beam. When the laser beam is interrupted, indicating a breach in the perimeter, the system triggers an alarm in the form of a buzzer and activates a red LED indicator. This project utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller along with various electronic components to achieve its functionality.

## Components Required
- Arduino Uno
- Red LED
- Laser module
- Buzzer
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## How It Works
1. **Setup**: Connect the components as follows:
   - Connect the positive (longer) leg of the LED to pin 7 on the Arduino through a current-limiting resistor. Connect the negative (shorter) leg to the ground.
   - Connect the positive terminal of the buzzer to pin 8 on the Arduino and the negative terminal to the ground.
   - Connect the LDR sensor to pin A0 on the Arduino.
   - Place the components on the breadboard and ensure all connections are secure.
   
2. **Code**: Upload the Arduino sketch provided (`laserTripWireSystem.ino`) to the Arduino Uno. This sketch includes the necessary logic to monitor the status of the laser beam and control the buzzer and LED accordingly.

3. **Operation**:
   - When the laser beam is unobstructed, the LDR sensor detects high light intensity, indicating the normal state.
   - If an object crosses the laser beam, the LDR sensor detects a decrease in light intensity.
   - The Arduino detects this change and triggers the buzzer to sound the alarm.
   - Simultaneously, the red LED lights up to visually indicate the breach.
   - The system continues to monitor the status of the laser beam, resetting once the beam is no longer obstructed.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Install the laser module at desired locations to create a perimeter.
   - Place the LDR sensor opposite the laser module to detect interruptions in the laser beam effectively.
   - Adjust the sensitivity of the LDR sensor if necessary to account for ambient light conditions.
   - Power the Arduino Uno using a suitable power source and ensure all connections are secure.
   - Test the system to verify its functionality and adjust parameters as needed.

5. **Enhancements**:
   - Implement wireless communication to receive alerts remotely.
   - Integrate with a camera system to capture images or videos upon breach.
   - Add a GSM module for SMS notifications.
   - Incorporate a microSD card module for logging breach events.
   - Explore options for power efficiency to extend battery life for portable deployments.
